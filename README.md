To set up the Pose-Based Exercise Tracker application:

Download and install the application on a compatible device (specify platform or provide a link if applicable).
Launch the application and position the device in a stable position to capture the person's exercise movements.
The computer vision algorithms will identify the pose of the person and provide real-time feedback on their exercise form.
The machine learning techniques will determine the success of each exercise rep and count only the successful repetitions.
The application will track the exercise start time, estimate the calories burned based on duration and intensity, and evaluate the person's performance.
Utilize the application to monitor exercise sessions, track progress, and improve performance.
